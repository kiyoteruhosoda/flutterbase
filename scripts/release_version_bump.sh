# Usage (CI only; needs a checkout with a token that may push to main):
#   bash scripts/release_version_bump.sh [auto|major|minor|patch]
#
# Called from two places:
#   - quality.yml, job `bump-version`: after every Quality job passed on a
#     push to main (the automatic release).
#   - version_bump.yml: the manual workflow_dispatch.
