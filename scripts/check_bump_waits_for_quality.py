"""Fail when quality.yml's `bump-version` job does not wait for every other job.

The release is gated by `needs:` (ADR-0019). A job added to quality.yml but
left out of `needs:` would run beside the bump, and a red run of it would still
be released. This check runs on every pull request so that gap shows up before
merging.

Plain text parsing on purpose: the job image has no YAML library, and the
shape it reads (two-space job ids under `jobs:`, a one-line `needs: [...]`) is
the shape this repository writes.
